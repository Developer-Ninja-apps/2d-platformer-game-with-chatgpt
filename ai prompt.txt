🎮 Step-by-Step Guide: Simple 2D Platformer in Unity
✅ Step 1: Set Up a New Unity Project
Open Unity Hub.

Click New Project.

Choose 2D Core or 2D template.

Name your project (e.g., Simple2DPlatformer) and click Create.

🗂️ Step 2: Set Up the Scene
In the Hierarchy, right-click and create a 2D Object > Sprite > Square.

This will be your Ground.

Rename it to Ground.

Scale it (Scale X = 10, Y = 1) and position it at (0, -4, 0).

Add a BoxCollider2D and Rigidbody2D to Ground.

In Rigidbody2D, check "Body Type" = Static (so it doesn't fall).

Create another square sprite for the Player.

Rename it to Player.

Position it above the ground (e.g., (0, 0, 0)).

Add:

BoxCollider2D

Rigidbody2D

🧠 Step 3: Create the Player Controller Script
Create a folder Scripts.

Right-click in that folder → Create > C# Script → name it PlayerController.

Double-click to open it in your code editor.

Replace the code with this:

csharp
Copy
Edit
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float moveSpeed = 5f;
    public float jumpForce = 10f;
    private Rigidbody2D rb;
    private bool isGrounded;

    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    }

    void Update()
    {
        float moveInput = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        rb.velocity = new Vector2(moveInput * moveSpeed, rb.velocity.y);

        if (Input.GetButtonDown("Jump") && isGrounded)
        {
            rb.velocity = new Vector2(rb.velocity.x, jumpForce);
        }
    }

    void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)
    {
        if (collision.contacts[0].normal.y > 0.5f)
        {
            isGrounded = true;
        }
    }

    void OnCollisionExit2D(Collision2D collision)
    {
        isGrounded = false;
    }
}
Attach this script to your Player GameObject.

🧱 Step 4: Add Platforms
Create more Sprite > Square objects.

Scale and position them around the scene to make platforms.

Add BoxCollider2D to each one.

Set Rigidbody2D to Static if you want them to stay in place.

🎨 Step 5: Add Some Visuals (Optional)
Replace square sprites with character and tile sprites (drag in PNGs).

Use the Sprite Renderer component to change visuals.

Import free 2D assets from the Unity Asset Store if you'd like.

🚀 Step 6: Play and Test
Click Play in the Unity Editor.

Use A/D or Arrow Keys to move.

Press Space to jump.

🔧 Bonus Tips
Add a CameraFollow script to make the camera follow the player.

Add animation using Animator and Animation components.

Add enemies, coins, or checkpoints later as upgrades!
